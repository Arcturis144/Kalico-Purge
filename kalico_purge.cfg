[kalico_purge]
default_length: 30.0
# Default purge line length (in mm).
# This defines how far the nozzle will extrude filament in a straight line.
# You can override this per-run using LENGTH=<value>.
default_speed: 1000.0
# Default purge move speed (in mm/min).
# This is the feedrate used during the purge line movement.
# Higher speeds purge faster but may lead to underextrusion with some filaments.
default_z_hop: 0.3
# Default Z-hop height above the bed (in mm).
# This is used to safely raise the nozzle before and after the purge.
# It helps prevent dragging the nozzle or hitting clips.
enable_poop_mode: False
# Enable support for spiral/blob style purge ("poop purge").
# If true, users can set POOP=1 to extrude in-place or in a spiral pattern.
# This is useful for transitioning filaments with strong visual or thermal offsets.
enable_ext_test: True
# Enable extrusion ramp test during purge.
# If true, setting EXT_TEST=1 will trigger an extrusion rate ramp and log heater performance.
# This is useful for determining max flow rate and heat stability for filament profiles.
